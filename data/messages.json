      "Cooking a pizza involves several steps. First, preheat your oven to the recommended temperature, usually around 475¬∞F (245¬∞C) for most pizzas. While the oven is heating, prepare your pizza by placing it on a pizza stone or baking sheet, and add your desired toppings. Once the oven is ready, carefully slide the pizza onto the center rack and bake it for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned. Keep an eye on it to prevent burning. Finally, use a pizza peel or spatula to remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, slice, and enjoy!",
      "The most optimal way to cook a pizza is in a brick oven with wood. These traditional ovens are known for their ability to reach extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 800¬∞F (427¬∞C). This intense heat is ideal for creating a perfectly crispy and charred crust in a matter of minutes. To cook a pizza in a brick oven, first, build a wood fire and let it burn until the oven reaches the desired temperature, typically around 800¬∞F (427¬∞C) or higher. Then, slide the pizza directly onto the oven floor using a wooden peel. The pizza will cook rapidly, usually in just a couple of minutes, thanks to the intense heat. Use a long-handled peel to retrieve the finished pizza, let it cool briefly, and serve for a truly authentic and delicious pizza experience.",
